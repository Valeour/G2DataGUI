/*
A run down of the various chunks found within these files:
NJCM chunk:
	contains all of the vertex and bone structure of the mode, used to create the wire frame
NMDM chunk:
	contains all of the model motion for animations, this I have not dug into significantly, as it is not critical to the mod tools
POF0:
	dictates what type of pointer offset is used, POF0 is from the start of the chunk, POF1(which is never used) is from the start of the file
GIXL chunk:
	used within content/data/afs/C0x folders and content/data/afs/map folders, states the magic numbers to link the uv texture file to this specific model
GBIX chunk:
	used within content/data/afs/model to specify that PVRT's(essentially the same as the content/data/afs/map uv texture file) magic number specifier
MCS_ chunk:
	I have no clue, it has some data that seems significant, but unsure how it plays into the data itself
GPHD chunk:
	starts the model motion chunk section of a content/data/afs/map/xxxx/xxxx.chr file
GAMT chunk:
	starts all but the first(GPHD) MIXL chunk of a content/data/afs/map/xxxx/xxxx.chr file
MIXL chunk:
	specifies the number of NMDM chunks within this MIXL chunk, and specifies which NJCM chunk(within the current file, starting at index 0) this series of NMDM chunks is tied to
